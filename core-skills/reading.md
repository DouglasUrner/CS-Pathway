Notes towards a [Reading Assessment & Intervention Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_uaE2YR7COytJC3DQLxi6bECeaFk97nYWnssua0OvdQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Assessing Reading Skill & Diagnosing Problems

* Assess specific skills in isolation - e.g., avoid making a writing task a reading assessment, or at the very least do not make writing quality a part of reading assessment.
  - Multiple choice.
* Allow alternative demonstrations of reading proficency - oral, drawing, write or debug code.

## Reading Interventions

* Building vocabulary
* Taking notes
* Modeling "reading behaviors"

### For Reading Code

* Teach code structure (blocking, matching braces, scope, how the language or runtime system works)
* Teach syntax
  - Recognizing syntax errors
