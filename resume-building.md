# Resume Building Activities

In-class activites (e.g., assigined and assessed work) to develop opportunities for getting real-world experience. Also see [career launch notes](https://github.com/DouglasUrner/CS-Careers/blob/master/career-launch.md).

The strategy is to ask students to undertake activities that will make them aware of opportunities to become part of a software development community. There is no requirement to actually pursue the opportunity, but the assignment asks for all of the work that would be necessary to apply or to take on a project. So, why not...

Common features of the assignments:
* Inventory skills - update resume
* Find an opportunity that matches your skills _and_ interests
  - General (e.g., Drupal office hours)
  - Specific (issue that you feel able and motivated to tackle)
* What could you learn
