## Work Based Learning (WBL) Option

Partner with local employers and agencies with CS related needs that can offer internship opportunities. At it's core an internship is:
* "Real" work on a team with industy mentors.
* Paying work.
* An opportunity to connect "book learning" to career plans.

The CTE adviory committee is built around the internship employers.

Every student who leaves the program takes away:
* Academic foundations for further work in CS, including AP/IB test scores and/or industry certifications.
* Work experience and a letter of recomendation.
* A resume showing experence in industry using industry standard tools and demonstrating the skills to collaborate on a team.
* A well-focused and articulated High School & Beyond Plan.

Acceptance into internships is competitive.

## In-School Option

Organized around a "school based enterprise" - a social impact game development studio. The work of the studio is designed to support students who are not ready for, or able to find, internship opportunities.

Some of the early classes in the internship option overlap with the in-school option, for example the A+ Certification class builds and maintains the gaming consoles used by the game development track for their public playtesting and marketing.

## Supporting Classes

## Capstone/Culminating Project

Extended (4-8 week) project that requires developing skills & knowledge not taught in the class.
