# In-School Option

Educational & Social-Impact Game Design Studio

Mission Statement: 

## Process Overview

Invite in community agencies to pitch projects - interactive experiences that would further their work - to the GDP1 classes. Each class hears one or two in-person pitches (which are recorded). Pitches are made in late-October or early-November after the classes have studied the principles of game design using existing social-impact games as case studies.

After the pitches the classes:

* Create concepts for the projects they were pitched.
* Present the pitches to the agenices.
* Get "offers" - the agencies decided if they will be willing to support the project

### In-House "Agencies"

Teachers, academic programs in the school, and the district could also pitch projects.
